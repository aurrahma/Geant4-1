1. Introduction

 This example demonstrates how to use UI-command base scoring.
It create parallel world(s) for defining scoring mesh(es).

 Since this UI-command base scoring is preliminary, this
functionality is not provided by default. To get it included,
the pointer to G4ScoringManager must be accessed. The access
to the static method G4ScoringManager::GetScoringManager()
activate this functionality. 

1.1 Geometry and primary particle

 It has just one water box in the world volume filled by air.
No detector in the mass geometry. Particle gun shoots a gamma
into the water box.

1.2 Physics

 The physics list is mostly identical to exampleN03. It does not
have hadronics.

2. Macro files

 "run1.mac" through "run4.mac" macro files should be used 
independently. Each macro file create its own scoring parallel
world(s). "vis.mac", "drawSlices.mac" and "drawCylinderSlices.mac" 
are used internally. Each macro should work for both interactively 
and batch, but interactive mode is advised for better visualization.

 IMPORTANT: DO NOT use more than one of these macro files in one
execution of this example.

3. RE03UserScoreWriter

 G4ScoringManager has a default score writer which dumps every
entry of one quantity of a mesh for all quantities of the mesh
one by one in CSV format. To alternate the file format the user
can implement his/her own score writer deriving from G4VUserScoreWriter
base class and set it to G4ScoringManager. To demonstrate this,
RE03UserScoreWriter is included in this example. To use this
alternative writer, un-comment its instantiation in RE03.cc.
